## You skipped class
Even with the coffee, you don't have the mental willpower to go to class today. 
What's the problem with missing class one day anyways? You might go ahead and email your professor later but you can get notes from your [[Friends]]. Plus you have homework you need to do...
But a nap seems really nice right now.
