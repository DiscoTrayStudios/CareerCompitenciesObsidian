## You went to class!
You arrive to class at 9:55. Only 10 minutes late? Not bad! You missed the beginning of the lecture, but it seems as if your professor hasn't started getting into things you didn't already know yet. 
*...*
Class went well! You took plenty of notes and feel on top of things. That caffeine helped a lot. 
Now that class is over do you want to work on homework or take a quick nap?
