Emotional Scene
Help a friend in need or study (Both have negative consequences)
- Help the friend going through a breakup
	- The friend feels better and nothing bad happens, they see you in good light
	- You fail the test the following day
- Study
	- Your friend isolates themselves.
	- You are not able to ask them for help in the future
		- Note: this is because they are so self isolated, not that they hate you
	- You pass the test the following day but feel bad

Make bad choice after bad choice, overextend yourself, get exhausted.
- Join every club
- Stay up as long as possible every chance you get
- Be friendly with everyone and go to parties
