- Have players make a sequence of choices that can set up future options, and then give them time to explore some of the campus and whats around. Maybe repeat this sequence a couple of times per year.
	- Potentially limit to only 1 or 2 visits around campus every time able to use the map
	- Could be split up between semesters
	

- Students need fun and relaxation. Have some sort of 'punishment' for students who do work-only career paths like burnout or something and miss out on competencies

- Have a special event once or twice a year, probably have most sophomore year. Something like career fair or majors fair or something.

- Have some negative options turn out well, like going to a party instead of going to sleep early. Meet someone at the party who suggest to go to career services, talk to a certain professor, make some friends, etc.

- Have a "Tour" that is the tutorial.
	- Alternatively, to cut down on time, have year 1 be the tutorial.

### QUESTIONS / OBSERVATIONS
##### Jonathon -
- Will the competencies be covered in class before playing this game? 
- Of course, we will want to make this game easy for anyone to pick up and play with no context, but how much time will we need to spend on explanations?
- If we need to reduce this to a 20 minute game, then each year will only take approximately 5 minutes. I don't see how this is possible realistically. That will be a game that is extremely easy to just blank out of and quickly go through. Also, some people read a lot slower than others. How do we account for all of these variables? 
- I predict that a full game will end up taking 30 minutes+ to properly play and enjoy.
- If we make year 1 the tutorial, then that should give us a significant amount of time to play with. Freshman year is the tutorial for the real college experience. 
- I currently have the full list of active [[Clubs|clubs/student run organizations]], so we will probably need to cut down on this to not overwhelm the player. Maybe we can organize them depending on what kind of organizatio/club it is (is it career based, does it make decisions that affect the college, is it just for fun)
