- Have players make a sequence of choices that can set up future options, and then give them time to explore some of the campus and whats around. Maybe repeat this sequence a couple of times per year.
	- Potentially limit to only 1 or 2 visits around campus every time able to use the map
	- Could be split up between semesters
	
- Students need fun and relaxation. Have some sort of 'punishment' for students who do work-only career paths like burnout or something and miss out on competencies

- Have a special event once or twice a year, probably have most sophomore year. Something like career fair or majors fair or something.

- Have some negative options turn out well, like going to a party instead of going to sleep early. Meet someone at the party who suggest to go to career services, talk to a certain professor, make some friends, etc.
	- It's always good to make connections

- If we did an actual tour then it would take a big chunk of our time I think.  
- Alternatively, to cut down on time, have year 1 be the tutorial.
	
- Rather than have everything be questions asked, we can insert a "daily" email that is sent to the player at multiple points in the game. This email will include opportunities that the player has and will have dates to go to specific buildings on campus. We can put the current date in these emails or display it somewhere else on screen.
	- I don't know how far we should jump for each "day".

###### Emotional Scene
Help a friend in need or study (Both have negative consequences)
- Help the friend going through a breakup
	- The friend feels better and nothing bad happens, they see you in good light
	- You fail the test the following day
- Study
	- Your friend isolates themselves.
	- You are not able to ask them for help in the future
		- Note: this is because they are so self isolated, not that they hate you
	- You pass the test the following day but feel bad

###### Mention getting rained during orientation (it happens every year, it's tradition.)
- "Ugh we got rained on during orientation. Oh well I'll probably look back on this and laugh... It is kinda funny that they said this happens every year."

###### Shirttails?
- Opt in
- Adds to some of the competencies
- Adds social and exhaustion

###### Maybe have a planning session? A way to visualize how to use your time.
- Plan a good schedule for school/life balance.
- Part-time job? Athletics? Other Extra-Curriculars (Choir, Band, etc.)? How much time do you plan to spend on homework each week? When do you go to sleep/wake up?
- Maybe this is something you talk to your advisor talks to you about.

###### Make bad choice after bad choice, overextend yourself, get exhausted.
- Join every club
	- every club is 1 pt of exhaustion
- Stay up as long as possible every chance you get
- Be friendly with everyone and go to parties
- Too much exhaustion = You fall asleep in your class and have to talk to your professor.
- Generally speaking, exhaustion will not just go down, this is because the decisions the player makes will be the trendsetters for what they are likely to do in the time not shown.

Freshman year - have a lot of experiences, make it easy to gain exhaustion
Sophomore year - work to get an internship/research opportunity


### QUESTIONS / OBSERVATIONS
##### Jonathon -
- Will the competencies be covered in class before playing this game? 
	- Of course, we will want to make this game easy for anyone to pick up and play with no context, but how much time will we need to spend on explanations?
- If we need to reduce this to a 20 minute game, then each year will only take approximately 5 minutes. I don't see how this is possible realistically. That will be a game that is extremely easy to just blank out of and quickly go through. Also, some people read a lot slower than others. How do we account for all of these variables? 
- I predict that a full game will end up taking 30 minutes+ to properly play and enjoy. Only time will tell if this ends up being the case.
- If we make year 1 the tutorial, then that should give us a significant amount of time to play with. Freshman year is the tutorial for the real college experience. 
- I currently have the full list of active [[Clubs|clubs/student run organizations]], so we will probably need to cut down on this to not overwhelm the player. Maybe we can organize them depending on what kind of organization/club it is (is it career based, does it make decisions that affect the college, is it just for fun)
- Whatever we decide to do for the characters and background, we need to do our best to make it to where the art styles go with each other, so we don't want one photorealistic and the other to be anime. Ideas could include putting GOOD pictures of the different places in Hendrix through a filter that gives it that look, or stylizing pictures manually. (I will look into making assets for this by next meeting.) TLDR: Make everything as consistent as possible. [MEDIUM PRIORITY]
