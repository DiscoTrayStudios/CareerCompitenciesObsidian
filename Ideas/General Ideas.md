- Have players make a sequence of choices that can set up future options, and then give them time to explore some of the campus and whats around. Maybe repeat this sequence a couple of times per year.
	- Potentially limit to only 1 or 2 visits around campus everytime able to use the map
	- Could be split up between semesters
	

- Students need fun and relaxtion. Have some sort of 'punishment' for students who do work-only career paths like burnout or something and miss out on compitencies

- Have a special event once or twice a year, probably have most sophmore year. Something like career fair or majors fair or something.

- Have some negative options turn out well, like going to a party instead of going to sleep early. Meet someone at the party who suggest to go to career services, talk to a certain professor, make some friends, etc.

- Have a "Tour" that is the tutorial.
	- Alternatively, to cut down on time, have year 1 be the tutorial.
