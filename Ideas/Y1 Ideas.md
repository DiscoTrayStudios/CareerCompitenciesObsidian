- For competencies. Have big end of the year group project. Depending on certain choices made, have Teamwork and Leadership be the competencies available
	- May be bad practice to group competencies together, but these two go well with each other and some of the other ones would be better saved for later years. 


- If we have an Event for Y1, could have a social event like the [[Clubs|club]] fair or OR trips to make more friends early on.
- Classes will be generic, but we can have Explorations be mentioned

Outline for Y1:
Welcome to Hendrix
Here's the basics of how to play
You are all moved in!
Go on your OR trip (details redacted) (mostly because I don't know what the OR trip entails)
Start going though your classes, with random emails that mean nothing to you. This should cause the player to start ignoring the email. 
(Try to put it in the style of Hendrix today)
Maybe have 4-8 "days"
