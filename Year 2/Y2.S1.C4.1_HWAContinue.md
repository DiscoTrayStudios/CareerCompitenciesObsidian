## You Continue Working
#### Academics | - Social | -- Sleep

You continue to work...
*... It's 12:10
... It's 12:11
... It's 12:12
Your eyes get heavy...
...
No you can't fall asleep! You need to focus!
...
... Wait a minute
...*

You check the time, It's 1:48A.M.
You fell asleep and didn't even realize it.

Defeated, and having made no progress on your work in the last 2 hours, you decide to go back to your room.

As you get back to your room you notice that your roommate is asleep. Of course they are.
Quietly, you get ready for bed and rest.

Tonight is not gonna be good sleep.
