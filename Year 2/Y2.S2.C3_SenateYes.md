## Yes Senate


#### Social ++

Okay, so since this the official student body government, it works a bit differently than the regular clubs. We're here now just to make people aware of it.

Essentially, all positions are specified bt a certain group, so for instance in order to be the Couch Senator, you must live in Couch.

Once it is time to prepare for elections, we will have interest meetings to make you aware of everything it will include.

After that, you can start campaigning and if you are voted in by your peers, you will attend weekly Tuesday meetings and joing one of the sub-committees.

We will present and discuss concerns of the student body and then you will inform your constituents of what is going on.

Once this process starts, you will be seeing it in HendrixToday.




"Sounds good, thank you and have a good day!"
