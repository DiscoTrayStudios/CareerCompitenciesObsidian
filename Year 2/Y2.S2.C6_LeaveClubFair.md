## You Head Off To Lunch After Seeing Clubs


After looking around at some of the clubs offered you feel pretty satisfied and decide to leave for the day

IF JOINED
You're excited by what joining a club will entail and are looking forward to your first meeting as you head in for lunch

IF NOT JOINED
Clubs arent really your thing, and that's okay! Time to get some lunch.
