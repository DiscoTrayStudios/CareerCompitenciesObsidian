Awesome! We're glad to have you! We usually have our meetings in the SLTC, but make sure to keep an eye out for updates in HendrixToday to see if we have a meeting scheduled!

They aren't required, but members who activley participate usually find themselves in leadership roles!

Sounds good, thank you and have a good day!
