## Student Senate

Hey there! We are the Hendrix College Student Senate, your student body government!

We are a diverse body of students focused on improving the Hendrix community and on representing YOU.

We're here to help you make Hendrix into the best place it can possibly be.

Our mission is to give direction and voice to student concerns, and providing a framework for a number of activities and services for students.

We also help to fund campus events such as SoCo 54, Toga, concerts, and more.

Is this something you may be interested in?
