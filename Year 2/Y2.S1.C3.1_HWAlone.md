#### + Academics | - Social
You get straight to work. After all, if you get everything done now then you can just relax later.
*... It's 6:00
... It's 7:00
... It's 7:30
...
It's Midnight.* 
What? How is it midnight already?
You could've sworn you weren't working for 6 hours straight.
Oh well... You should probably head back to your room and get some rest... But you are almost done with all your work, maybe just finish it up real quick?

[[Y2.S1.C4.1_HWASleep|We can finish it later. Let's just go back to the room.]]
