## You Decide To Go Into The Snoddy Center
#### + Academics | ++ Social

It will be good to be around people.
As long as everybody is working as well it will work out!
Plus, you can bounce ideas off of people.

As you head into the Snoddy Center your friends recognize you and wave.

p "Hey, can I do my work with you guys?"
f "Of course! Everyone, this is {p}. {p} this is {r1}, {r2}, and {r3}"

*Add in Dialogue*
Everyone says their hellos and goes to do their work...
As time passes you get stuck and ask for help.
They were actually extremely helpful and you got work done really quick.
You talk about yourself a little bit and get to know them.
They mention that the party that's starting soon..
Wait what?
It's 8:30!
Oh yeah you got emails about that party starting at 9:00 this morning.
They are all going together and wonder if you want to join them...
Do you?
