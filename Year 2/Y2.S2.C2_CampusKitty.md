## Campus Kitty

 Hi there! We're Campus Kitty, a non-profit organization that raises money for local charities!
 
We plan and implement a week-long series of charity fundraising events geared toward the entire campus every spring.

Campus Kitty Week is one of the most popular times of the year at Hendrix, and culminates in the most anticipated night of the year--the Miss Hendrix Pageant.

Last year, Campus Kitty raised more than $38,000 in money and goods, providing for 10 local charities.

Our goal is to raise as much money and have as much fun as possible while doing so!

Are you interested in joining?
