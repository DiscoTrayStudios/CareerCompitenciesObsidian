## Let's do Career Term

Some time passes and Career Term occurs.

Workshops cover topics such as résumé writing and job interview skills, graduate school planning and preparations, how to find an internship, professional dress and etiquette, networking and personal branding, and professional communication. Hendrix alumni share their professional experiences, answer students' career questions, and offer students important insight on networking and making connections in the professional world.

During one of your small group workshops, you get into a conversation with one of the speakers. They interest you and might be able to help you as a connection on your new LinkedIn account!
