## KHDX

Whats up! We are KHDX-FM 93.1, the Hendrix College student-run radio station!

Our mission is to provide unique programming to campus, the city of Conway, and the globe through the FM airwaves, digital streaming, and our website.

 We accomplish this goal by allowing students to create and broadcast content with which they are deeply connected.
 
 Our passions manifest in the form of recorded and live music, spoken word, news, sports, and educational programming.
 
 In DJ and executive staff positions, students get a chance to engage in developing content, organizing events, and managing/participating in a volunteer-based organization that impacts the student experience on Hendrix campus.
 
 The result is a station that represents the dynamic diversity of our student body.
 
 We also book musical events and have even had artists at the school such as Lizzo, Black Bear, and Iann Dior! 
 
 Are you interested in joining?
