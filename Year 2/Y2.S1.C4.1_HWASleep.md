## You Decide to Sleep
#### Academics | Social | + Sleep

You should probably just go to sleep. 
Your eyes are already a little heavy anyways and the rest of the work can wait until later.

You get back to the room and your roommate isn't there... Oh well I'm sure they will show up later. 

You get ready for bed and as your head hits your pillow you fall into a whimsical world of dreams. It would be nice if you would've spent some time with people today, but there's always tomorrow. Your dreams reflect a social need.

#### Recap: All work No play, Good sleep though
- Focusing on school is good and all, but you might not be able to work with people if you keep doing things like this
