## SOCO


Hey, we're the Social Committee, or SOCO for short.

We are responsible for hosting creative, social events on campus.Â  These range from themed parties to recreational events and film screenings.

We help bind the Hendrix community together and help create some of the biggest events of the year, such as our Formal Dance or SoCo 54.
