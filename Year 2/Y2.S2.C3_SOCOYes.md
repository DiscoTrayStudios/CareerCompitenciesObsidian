## Yes to Soco


#### Social +


Sweet! I hope you enjoy your time with us!  We usually have our meetings in the SLTC, but make sure to keep an eye out for updates in HendrixToday to see if we have a meeting scheduled!

They aren't required, but members who activley participate usually find themselves in leadership roles!

"Sounds good, thank you!"
