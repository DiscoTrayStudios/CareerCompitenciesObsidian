## Go to talk

"Bob walks with you to the talk, also interested in what there is to learn"

bob "So, is this your first time at the Career and Internship Fair, [name]?"

p "Yeah it is, I'm just a freshman so this is my first one."

bob "Hey way to get started early! I wish I had started coming to these my freshman year. I had no idea you could learn so much from them."

p "I'm excited. This should be fun!"

"You both enter the room and take a seat. Someone walks on stage and begins to talk about personal accountability."

"The talk develops and you become encapsulated by what the speaker is saying. You learn a lot throughout this talk and walk out feeling a higher sense of responsibility."

"{i}Professionalism achieved!"

bob "That was great! I really didn't expect to get that much out of it."

p "No me neither, I'm glad we did this!"
