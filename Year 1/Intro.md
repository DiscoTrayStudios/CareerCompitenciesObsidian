# Welcome to Hendrix!
"You just got moved into your dorm room in Couch Hall." 
##### I said Couch since it is not gender-exclusive. However, we can let the players choose later on if we want.
"Your roommate isn't here yet, but hey that just means that you get the first pick on everything!"
##### We can add randomization here to where some people will get there first and some will get there last. 

##### Once you encounter the roommate

show r
r "Hey! I'm your roommate _**#(@)$)@#()**_ what's your name?"

p = "[p]"

r "Alright [p], nice to meet ya."

"_Wait what did they just say their name was.... did it say it on the door? I don't remember.. I'll just call them Roomie._"
