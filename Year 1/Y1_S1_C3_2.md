You need it for your plans! it will be best for the both of you.
Player "Hey [Roomie], can we switch spots.. I really want to be able to set up that space with my TV and other things cause it has more outlets and I see you don't have as many electronics.."

"They give you a weird look. Was it because you called them Roomie instead of their name?
Roomie Um no I like this spot, and I chose it first."

Player "Come onnnn."

Roomie "No."

"_You are kind of disappointed and you may have made a bad first impression with your roomie..._"
