## Look at the door for their name
"You decide to look at the door."
"Their name is [Charlie]! Good to know."
"They kind of give you a weird look as you just open the door, look at it, then close it again..."

"Then you notice that [Charlie] started setting up on the side of the dorm you wanted. You had plans!" 
"You were gonna have more outlets, control of the window and AC, and the closet in the arguably better space." 

[[Y1_S1_C3_1|Ask for the space and explain your plans with it.]]
[[Y1_S1_C4|Just live with it, you snooze you lose.]]
[[Y1_S1_C5|Let's get to know them first.]]
