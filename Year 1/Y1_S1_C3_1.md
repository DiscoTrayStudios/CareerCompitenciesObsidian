## You ask for the space.
"You need it for your plans! it will be best for the both of you."

Player "Hey [Charlie], can we switch spots.. I really want to be able to set up that space with my TV and other things cause it has more outlets and I see you don't have as many electronics.."

Charlie "I don't know, I like this spot.. What will I get out of trading spots with you?"

Player "You will get to play with me on my console."

Charlie "So if I don't I won't be able to??"

Player "If you don't I might not have enough outlets to even hook it up."

Charlie "Ugh fine." 

"_Charlie reluctantly gives you the spot you want, however, you don't think they are happy about this and it may affect your future_"
