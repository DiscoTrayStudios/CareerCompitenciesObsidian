## Student 1:

I just played it! I thought it was really awesome how they got the graphics to match Hendrix! I also liked the diversity of the characters and how they incorporated information about resources available to students. The only comment I do have is that I feel the game would take long to complete and could be info heavy depending on how long students are expected to play, and I think visiting the offices first then playing the game could be great for those who are not visual/gaming learners (granted I did not play the entire game).

## Student 2:

Here are my notes!

~~No avatars were displayed for myself or for the person I was talking to when I clicked on the burrow and talked to Dr. Smith and when talking to Dr. Orozco at mills.

I like the hendrix today feature!

~~When visiting career services and learning about career competencies, Eileen lists each one as its own dialogue, and if it were me then I’d prefer to be presented with a list of them instead of clicking through each 8. I got impatient and wanted to quickly click through all of them, and I would’ve preferred to view them all at once, but that’s just a personal preference

~~I like the link to the 4 year plan, should there also be a link included to meet with career services?

Mentions hirehendrix—> include link to hirehendrix?

Include link to student organizations page when talking about the clubs?

~~Clicked on burrow—> no person shows up for Dr. Smith or my own character

~~Dr. Orozco at mills—> no characters shown

Typos:

-   ~~Tutorial: “give you, the player AND insight”—> “an”
-   ~~Meeting roommate: “INTERESED in athletics?” —> “interested”
-   ~~Burrow: include comma—> “Our programs are highly renowned, and we have graduates all over the world doing incredible things”
-   ~~Mills: “Are you HEAR to learn”—> “here”
-   ~~Some dialogues have periods at the end of the sentences and some don’t

## Burris, Tricia

Played today--- it's looking SOOOOO good! 

Just a few suggestions:

**Character Creator—**

~~Change question to “What are your pronouns” (remove the word “preferred”)

**Career & Internship Fair**— ~~perhaps change the word “encapsulated” to “captivated” or “intrigued”

**Mills**— ~~Social Science—No avatar for Dr. Orozco

**Career Services**—I see the student’s point about clicking through the Career Competencies. Is it possible just to list the 8 and then link to the site or a pdf that includes the descriptions?
