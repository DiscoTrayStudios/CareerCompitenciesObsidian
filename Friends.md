John
You have no other friends and don't remember John's last name... Or if John is even his name.

Claire 
In a couple of your classes. They're nice and helps with homework!

Michelle
She was in your OR trip. Very adventerous and go with the flow, which can sometimes be trouble.

Evan 
Very type-A person. The kind of person who knows every decision they'll make over the next year

Roommate
This is your roommate... You always call them roomie. You could just look at the door for their name, but that's up to you. (Their name is __Charlie__)
